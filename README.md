# movie-api

This repository contains an API created with Node.js that allows users to access information about movies, genres, directors, etc. The data are stored in a Mongo databse and the API interacts with it via Mongoose.

A live version of the API can be found at https://klaus-movies.herokuapp.com/.

The documentation for the API is available at [Heroku](https://klaus-movies.herokuapp.com/documentation.html) and [here on Github](https://darisam.github.io/movie-api/public/documentation.html).
